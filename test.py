#1.Initialization:

# Initialize a score variable to keep track of the player's points.
# Show a welcome message and rules to the player.
#2. Game Setup:

# Generate a starting number or randomly select a card from a deck.
# Show the player the initial number or card.
#3. Game Rounds:

# Ask the player to predict if the next number/card will be higher or lower.
# Accept the player's input (higher/lower).
# Generate the next number/card.
# Compare the generated number/card with the previous one.
# If the player's prediction matches the comparison:
# Increment the score.
# Show a message indicating a correct prediction.
# If the player's prediction doesnâ€™t match the comparison:
# End the game.
# Display the final score.
# Ask the player if they want to play again.
#4. Repeat or End:

# If the player wants to play again, start a new game from step 2.
# If the player doesn't want to continue, show a goodbye message and end the game.
# Optional Enhancements:

# Implement difficulty levels (e.g., changing the range of numbers or using different decks for cards).
# Incorporate a leaderboard to track high scores.
# Add lifelines or hints for the player.
# Game Loop:

# Continuously loop through steps 2-4 until the player decides to stop playing.
# The game essentially involves predicting whether the next number or card will be higher or lower than the current one. 
# The player's score increases with each correct prediction until they decide to stop or make an incorrect guess.
